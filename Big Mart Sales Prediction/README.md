## Project Overview
The Market Sales Prediction project is a data science solution aimed at predicting sales for products across various outlets. By understanding the key drivers behind sales performance, this project helps optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and promotional efforts.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Big Mart Sales Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivan118/big-mart-sales-prediction-datasets)

The dataset used in this project has the following columns:
  * **Item_Identifier:** Unique identifier for each item.
  * **Item_Weight:** Weight of the item (some missing values).
  * **Item_Fat_Content:** Indicates whether the item is low fat or regular.
  * **Item_Visibility:** Percentage visibility of the item in the store.
  * **Item_Type:** Category/type of the item (e.g., Dairy, Meat).
  * **Item_MRP:** Maximum retail price of the item.
  * **Outlet_Identifier:** Unique identifier for each outlet.
  * **Outlet_Establishment_Year:** Year when the outlet was established.
  * **Outlet_Size:** Size of the outlet (some missing values).
  * **Outlet_Location_Type:** Tiered categorization of the outlet's location.
  * **Outlet_Type:** Type of outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket).
  * **Item_Outlet_Sales:** Sales of the item at the respective outlet (target variable).
